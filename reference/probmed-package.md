# probmed: Probabilistic Effect Sizes for Causal Mediation Analysis

Compute P_med, a scale-free probabilistic effect size for causal
mediation analysis.

Compute P_med, a scale-free probabilistic effect size for causal
mediation analysis. P_med = P(Y\_{x\*,M_x} \> Y\_{x,M_x}) represents the
probability that the outcome under treatment with the mediator at its
control level exceeds the outcome under control.

Compute P_med, a scale-free probabilistic effect size for causal
mediation analysis.
